<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![product-screenshot](src/images/screenshot.png)


This project will help you in searching any related trailers of a movie which you desire and u will be able to watch the trailer and also can read the details and description regarding that movie which will be fetched directly from the official IMDb site. 

Here's why you should love this assignment:
* I am fluent in React.js, learning next.js and also Vue.js for better graphics and functionality.
* Getting to know Funfacts about API's and creating own api was fun and insightful, this is the very first implementation of the same.
* I have used OMDb's api to fetch the list of movies details which u will click on and used rapid Api (3rd party) for fetching data of movies and also its Youtube trailer from that api only and created a seperate own api to aggregate both the api's and work the functionalities.
* You will find good code quality and code standards which can be used to demonstrate to beginners, if not no issues as we are in an agile world. Learning continously:)


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
